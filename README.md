Front-end Scaffold for Use with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
================================================================

Includes [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) for CommonJS-style module wrapping, [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) for structure,
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) for CSS pre-processing, sourcemaps for CSS and CoffeeScript,
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for templating, [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) for markup, live-reload for automatic page-refreshes during development and Mocha + PhantomJS for unit testing.

Project Setup
-------------
- Install Node
 - [Node.js Installer](http://nodejs.org/)
- Install Gulp globally
 - `sudo npm install -g gulp`
- Clone and cd into the repo
 - `git clone https://github.com/WINTR/gulp-frontend-scaffold.git && cd gulp-frontend-scaffold`
- Then install Gulp task dependencies
 - `npm install`

Development Tasks
-----------------

- For development: `gulp dev` then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or IP address).
- For deploy: `gulp build`

This concatinates and minifies all CoffeeScript, Stylus, and Jade and moves the project into 'dist' for production deploy.

Bower
-----
Bower is used for client-side package management.  Packages installed via bower are then copied over to `vendor` via `gulp bower` and each time you run `gulp dev`.

- To search for packages
 - `bower search {package name}`
- To install a package
 - `bower install {package name} --save`
 - `gulp bower`
 - Add the path to the new lib into the `concat` task in `gulpfile.coffee` and save


Unit Testing
------------
Mocha is used as the default for unit tests.  Via gulp-mocha-phantomjs, unit tests can be run in both the terminal as well as the browser.

- To execute tests via PhantomJS
 - `gulp test`
- To test in browser
 - Run `gulp test`
 - Navigate to `test/html/index.html`
- When running `gulp dev`, tests are automatically re-run on save of either your source or your spec files and should trigger a reload in the browser.


A Few Notes on Folder Structure
-------------------------------

- **Assets** like **images**, **audio**, **webfonts**, **etc** are created in `src/assets` and will automatically be moved over to the **public** folder, mirroring the folder structure where they came from.
- **Markup** is written in Jade in the root of the `source` directory (which will compile to the root of the `public` directory).
- **Scripts** such as **CoffeeScript** and **JavaScript** are placed here and compiled over to public via **Browserify**.  For those not familiar, Browserify allows for "CommonJS" style modules to be required inside internal files.  Attachments to the global namespace are no longer needed, and dependencies are traced at compile-time. (Example:  `var MyClass = require('./path/to/MyClass')`)  See the Browserify website for more information.
- **Styles** is where **SASS** files go, and are compiled over to **public** on save.
- **Vendor** is where are vendor sources go, from both **Bower** (via `bower install {package}` and then `gulp bower`) as well as manually.  When changes are made to this directory, the **GruntFile** `concat` task should be updated to include the newly added files
- **Tests** is where your **Mocha** tests and their accompanying html are located.  When developing, test files are **continually evaluated** and, if need be, compiled into `test/spec/spec-runner.js` to be run in the **browser**.
